KTM 390 Duke Engine
The KTM 390 Duke is a high-performance naked bike designed for both urban commuting and thrilling weekend rides. Powered by a cutting-edge engine, the 390 Duke delivers a perfect blend of power, agility, and efficiency. It’s a motorcycle built for riders who crave adrenaline while maintaining the versatility for everyday use. The heart of the 390 Duke is its compact yet powerful 373cc engine, which is engineered to offer an exhilarating experience on the streets, making it one of the top contenders in the entry-level performance motorcycle market.
Features:
* Single-Cylinder, Liquid-Cooled Engine: The 390 Duke’s engine is a 373cc single-cylinder powerhouse that is liquid-cooled, providing optimal temperature regulation even during high-speed runs. The liquid-cooling system ensures that the engine performs at its best, even in demanding riding conditions, preventing overheating and maintaining efficiency.
* Fuel Injection and Ride-by-Wire Technology: The Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) system offers precise control over the fuel-air mixture for more efficient combustion and improved fuel economy. The ride-by-wire throttle technology ensures smoother throttle response and enhanced riding precision, whether you're cruising at low speeds or gunning for the open road.
* DOHC Valve Train: The Dual Overhead Cam (DOHC) design allows for more precise control over the engine’s intake and exhaust valves, optimizing power delivery across a wide RPM range. This results in better acceleration, higher power output, and greater engine efficiency.
* 6-Speed Gearbox with Quickshifter: The 390 Duke is equipped with a 6-speed constant mesh gearbox, which provides smooth, quick shifts and the ability to extract maximum performance from the engine. For better handling during gear shifts, the bike features an optional quickshifter, allowing riders to upshift without using the clutch for a more fluid riding experience.
* Lightweight and Compact Design: KTM’s focus on lightweight construction extends to the engine, which is designed to minimize weight while maintaining durability. The lightweight engine contributes to the overall weight reduction of the bike, improving handling, braking, and fuel efficiency. It’s a key factor in the bike’s agility on tight corners and in city traffic.
* Exhaust System: The 390 Duke uses a slip-on exhaust system that enhances engine performance while producing a deep, throaty exhaust note. The design of the exhaust not only reduces weight but also contributes to the bike’s overall aerodynamic profile, improving speed and stability.
